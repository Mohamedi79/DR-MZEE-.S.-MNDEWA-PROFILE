        wireless communications</a></h2>
    <p> Technological improvements in free space
    optical communication systems have reduced the cost
    and alternatives to fiber optic transmission. The advantages
    of the free space optical link over fiber optic cabling are
    primarily economic. In line with the demand for gigabyte
    link from 10Mbit/s to 10Gbit/s in the market, the uses of
    free space optical communication systems have increased
    exponentially from 1995 to 2008. However, free space
    optics is subject to atmospheric effects such as attenuation
    and scintillation which can reduce link availability and
    may introduce errors not seen in fiber transmission. In this
    paper we argue that optical wireless communication is an
    alternative to fiber optic transmission in short and medium
    range wireless communications and we discuss that the
    liability and availability of the free space optical link is
    mainly determined by the local atmospheric condition, this
    is to say that the transmission quality may be affected by
    weather conditions.

    turbulence</a></h2>
    <p>The purpose of this report is to present an
     experimental study of the effects of light propagation
     through atmospheric turbulence. Free space optical com
    munication is a line-of-sight technology that transmits a
     modulated beam of visible light through the atmosphere
     for broadband communication. The fundamental limita
    tions of free space optical communications arise from the
     environment through which it propagates. However these
     systems are vulnerable to atmospheric turbulence, such as
    attenuation and scintillation. Scintillation is due to the air
    index variation under the temperature effects. These factors
    cause an attenuated receiver signal and lead to higher bit
    error rate (BER). An experiment of laser propagation was
    carried out to characterize the light intensity through
    turbulent air in the laboratory environment. The experi
    mental results agree with the calculation based on Rytov
     for the case of weak to intermediate turbulence. Also, we
    show the characteristics of irradiance scintillation, inten
    sity distribution and atmospheric turbulence strength</p>
